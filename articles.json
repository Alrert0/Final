  "category": "Sport",
  "content": "Florida basketball coach Todd Golden acknowledged an ongoing university inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, stalking, and cyberstalking, and stated he is considering defamation claims against his accusers. Golden, 39, is being investigated after a Title IX complaint was filed against him on September 27, detailing allegations including unwanted sexual advances on Instagram, requesting sexual favors, and sending explicit photos. Golden has hired attorney Ken Turkel for advice on pursuing legal action. Despite the investigation, Golden continues to coach the 21st-ranked Gators, preparing for their game against Grambling State. The university has not publicly confirmed the investigation, as federal law prevents comments on Title IX inquiries. This is the third serious set of allegations under athletic director Scott Stricklin's tenure. Previously, Stricklin saw two other coaches, Cam Newbauer and Tony Amato, leave amid allegations of abuse and misconduct.",

  "category": "Science",
  "content": "New research confirms that the rotation of Earth’s inner core has been slowing down as part of a decades-long pattern. The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest that the core’s spin has slowed since 2008 and may soon begin to speed up again. Researchers have tracked seismic waves from earthquakes to observe changes in the core’s rotation, revealing a 70-year cycle of acceleration and deceleration. The inner core, a solid ball of metal surrounded by a liquid outer core, influences Earth’s magnetic field, but the full impact of the core’s slowing spin is still uncertain. ",

  "content": "Scientists at the University of Southampton have successfully stored the entire human genome on a revolutionary '5D memory crystal,' a durable storage medium capable of withstanding extreme conditions. This crystal, which holds up to 360 terabytes of data, is designed to last billions of years, potentially providing a blueprint for restoring species in the future. The crystal, recognized by Guinness World Records for its durability, uses ultra-fast lasers to inscribe genomic data into nanostructures, translating information into five dimensions: height, length, width, orientation, and position. The memory crystal is housed in the Memory of Mankind archive in Austria, and the project may offer a way to preserve plant, animal, and human data for future generations. Although the technology is groundbreaking, challenges remain about how the data could be read in the distant future.",

  "date": "2024-11-09",
  "category": "Science",
  "content": "In a breakthrough study published in *Science*, researchers have discovered that a yellow food coloring, commonly used in snack foods, can make the skin of mice temporarily transparent. By applying a solution of tartrazine, a food dye, mixed with water, the researchers were able to reveal internal organs and blood vessels beneath the skin without surgery or damage. The process works by altering the refractive index of the skin, enabling better light transmission. This discovery could revolutionize biomedical research, particularly for visualizing blood vessels, veins, and internal organs in living organisms. The method has the potential to improve medical procedures such as blood draws and cancer detection. However, the technique has not been tested on humans, and further research is needed to determine its applicability in humans.",

  "content": "A new breakthrough in biohybrid robotics combines the living organism, king oyster mushrooms, with synthetic robot components to create robots controlled by the electrical signals of fungi. Researchers at Cornell University have engineered robots that are powered by mycelium, the root-like structure of the mushroom, which senses and reacts to environmental stimuli through electrical signals. This innovative work marks a step forward in biohybrid robotics, a field combining biological materials and engineered systems. Though still experimental, biohybrid robots have the potential to perform complex tasks, such as delivering fertility treatments or searching for earthquake survivors. The study details how the fungi's mycelium integrates with the robots' hardware and communicates via electrical signals, offering insights into how biological systems can enhance technological functions.",
